## To run on Heroku:

- Install Heroku CLI
- Configure the remote to use the heroku remote in addition to the github remote, if desired.
- `heroku local web`
- The application should now be running at `http://localhost:4200/`

## Editing
- Access http://localhost:4200/admin and log in using the credentials you set up when you ran `python manage.py createsuperuser`.
- First, we'll replace the default site with our own. Click on Explorer > Welcome to your new wagtail site!.
- In the top left of the teal bar, click the home icon. This is where root pages to the site live.
- Lets add a child page. We'll pick `Home Page`
- Add some content and click publish at the bottom of the window.\*
- We also need to ad a footer. The page won't render properly without something to put there.
- In the menu, click Snippets, and then on Footers.
- In the top right hand corner, you'll see a button to add a new footer.
- There must be one footer with the 'active' checkbox marked checked. If you check active on a different footer, it will deactivate all other footers.
- At the bottom of the window, press save.
- Your new page should be ready to view.

*\*When developing new pages on a live site, one should preview the page first.*
